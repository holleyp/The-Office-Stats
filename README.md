# The-Office-Stats
This is a project that looks at a few statistics involving the lines spoken on the TV show The Office.
I compare the amount of lines spoken between characters and the ratings of the episodes they are in a number of ways.
There is also a comparison of how often "That's what she said" occurs and the average season rating.

The file I used for this is included as the_office_dialogue.csv
